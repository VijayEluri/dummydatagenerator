Enhancements that would be nice.  Some are already planned, others
might or might not ever happen.  

(in no particular order)

1. Output "social graph" links (eg, "Joe is friends with Cindy, and Mike is friends with Bob," etc.)
2. Implement the -prompt interactive command mode
3. Add additional output formats and implement the -o <outputspec> command line switch
4. FOAF output
5. XML output
6. JSON output
7. A JDBC module so that generated records can be pumped directly into a database
8. A GUI?
9. Add additional data fields:  SSN, date-of-birth, place-of-birth, OpenID, username, homepage, etc.
10. Clean up and modularize the code.  It's pretty monolithic right now.
11. Add the ability to specify the name of the output file.
12. Switches for more fine grained control over the generated data.  For example, the ability to get USA only or CAN only
  addresses, or to exclude certain states, etc.
13. ??
